     Reading data from directory:
     ./CCO.save/
     Message from routine readpp:
     file ./CCO.save/O_PBE.UPF not found

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = PBE ( 1  4  3  4 0 0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
